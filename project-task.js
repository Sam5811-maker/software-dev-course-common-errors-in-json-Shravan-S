üè® JSON Syntax Debugging: Hotel Booking Data
===========================================

üéØ Objective:
Students will analyze a JSON file containing multiple syntax errors,
identify the issues, and correct them.

This activity helps practice spotting and fixing common JSON mistakes such as:
- Missing commas
- Incorrect use of quotation marks
- Unmatched brackets/braces
- Trailing commas
- Invalid data types

// üß≠ Instructions:
// ============================================

/*
üìò Scenario:
You‚Äôre a developer on a team building a travel booking API.

A teammate submitted a JSON file to represent a hotel booking, 
but it contains multiple syntax errors that prevent it from being parsed.

üîß Your Task:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Review the provided JSON file
2Ô∏è‚É£ Identify all syntax errors
3Ô∏è‚É£ Write down what each error is and why it causes a problem
4Ô∏è‚É£ Correct the JSON structure so that it is valid
5Ô∏è‚É£ Validate your corrected version using a JSON linter or validator

üß™ Deliverables:
- A corrected version of the JSON
- A list of the corrections made and why each was necessary

// ============================================
// üîç Provided JSON File with Errors
// ============================================

const invalidBookingJSON = `
{
  "hotelName": "Grand City Hotel",
  "checkInDate": "2024-05-15"
  "checkOutDate": "2024-05-20",
  "guests": [
    {
      name: "Alice Johnson",
      "age": 30,
      "email": "alice.johnson@example.com"
    },
    {
      "name": "Bob Smith",

  }
}
`;


// ============================================
// ‚úÖ Requirements
// ============================================

/*
- Use a JSON validator or linter (e.g., https://jsonlint.com/) to test your final version
- Keep track of each fix:
  ‚Ä¢ What was wrong?
  ‚Ä¢ Why is it a problem in JSON?
      Invalid JSON!
      Error: Parse error on line 1:
      const invalidBooking
      ^
    Expecting 'STRING', 'NUMBER', 'NULL', 'TRUE', 'FALSE', '{', '[', got 'undefined'

    ‚Ä¢ What did you change to fix it?
        removed line 1 
        missing , on line 4 checkInDate
        missing "" for kay name line 8
        line 14 undefined is not a valide datatype in JSON, insteda use null
        line 21 extra , at the end of the array amenities
        removed line 24 `;

// ü§î Follow-Up Questions
// ============================================

/*
üí¨ Reflect and answer the following:

1Ô∏è‚É£ What tools or techniques did you use to identify the errors?
I have used JSONLint online tool to identify the erroes

2Ô∏è‚É£ How did you confirm that your corrected JSON file was valid?
anfter testing in JSONLint the corrected code showed no errors and said JSON is valid

3Ô∏è‚É£ Which errors were the most difficult to spot? Why?
especially identifying punctuations and brackets are kind of difficult especially when the data structure is a complex one

4Ô∏è‚É£ What strategies can help you avoid these kinds of errors in the future?
   (e.g., syntax highlighting, linters, writing JSON by example)
   using 
   online tools like JSONLint
   allications like VScode has inbuilt or extensions to detect these kind of defects
   error stacks in the terminal or the browsers
   debugging with APIs or consols
